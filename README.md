The research goals of this thesis are to explore the possibilities and limitations of
replicating human grip abilities in VR, evaluate benefits and challenges thereof,
empirically compare usability and performance to the status quo, and encourage a more
thorough engagement with this topic in the industry and research.

Please get in touch if you are interested in the thesis. I will gladly send it to you.
